# Grav DateTranslations plugin

Date Translations provides twig function/filter `dt(DATE, FORMAT)` that provides translations for dates using [Date](https://github.com/jenssegers/date) as a wrapper around Carbon.

# Installation

As this plugin is not yet in the Grav repository, you need to install it manually. From your plugins folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/paulcmal/grav-plugin-datetranslations
mv grav-plugin-socialmeta datetranslations
```

# Usage

`dt()` takes two arguments:
- a string parsable by the [Carbon API](https://github.com/briannesbitt/Carbon) for a date (in English)
- a [dateformat](http://php.net/manual/fr/function.date.php), or one of the translations

For example:
```
    {{ 'now'|dt('Y') }}
    <br>{{ 'now'|dt('long') }}
    <br>{{ 'first day of next month'|dt('long') }}
    <br>{{ 'last day of next month'|dt('long') }}
    <br>{{ 'first day of next month'|dt('short') }}
    <br>{{ dt('first day of next month','short') }}
    <br>{{Â dt('+1 year', 'long') }}
```
